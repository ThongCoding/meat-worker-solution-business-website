          <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>
            The Terms are governed by the laws of Queensland, Australia. Any
            dispute, controversy, proceeding or claim of whatever nature arising
            out of or in any way relating to the Terms and the rights created
            hereby shall be governed, interpreted and construed by, under and
            pursuant to the laws of Queensland, Australia, without reference to
            conflict of law principles, notwithstanding mandatory rules. The
            validity of this governing law clause is not contested. The Terms
            shall be binding to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
            successors and assigns.
          </p>
          <h2>8. Independent Legal Advice</h2>
          <p>
            Both parties confirm and declare that the provisions of the Terms
            are fair and reasonable and both parties having taken the
            opportunity to obtain independent legal advice and declare the Terms
            are not against public policy on the grounds of inequality or
            bargaining power or general grounds of restraint of trade.
          </p>
          <h2>9. Severance</h2>
          <p>
            If any part of these Terms is found to be void or unenforceable by a
